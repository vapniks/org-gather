* Plan
** Overview
Two main commands: `org-gather-into-table', `org-gather-into-property-tree'\\
Each of these functions loops over buffers to gather information for the specified columns/properties respectively.
** Specification
*** org-gather-into-property-tree
User should be able to specify org properties, with corresponding functions used to obtain the values for each property.
The `org-gather-into-property-tree' command should then loop over some objects (e.g. buffers, directories, items in list),
to obtain the property values for each header of the final property tree.
*** org-gather-into-table
User should be able to specify column headers, with corresponding functions used to obtain the values for each column.
The `org-gather-into-table' command should then loop over some objects (e.g. buffers, directories, items in list),
to obtain the column entries for each row of the final table.
