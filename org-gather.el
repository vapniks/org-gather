;;; Commentary: 
;;
;; Bitcoin donations gratefully accepted: 1FgnGFwRES9MGzoieRDWLmLkjqMT3AsjQF
;;
;; How to create documentation and distribute package:
;;
;;     1) Remember to add ;;;###autoload magic cookies if possible
;;     2) Generate a bitcoin address for donations with shell command: bitcoin getaccountaddress org-gather
;;        and place address after "Commentary:" above.
;;     3) Use org-readme-top-header-to-readme to create initial Readme.org file.
;;     4) Use M-x auto-document to insert descriptions of commands and documents
;;     5) Create documentation in the Readme.org file:
;;        - Use org-mode features for structuring the data.
;;        - Divide the commands into different categories and create headings
;;          containing org lists of the commands in each category.
;;        - Create headings with any other extra information if needed (e.g. customization).
;;     6) In this buffer use org-readme-to-commentary to fill Commentary section with
;;        documentation from Readme.org file.
;;     7) Make any necessary adjustments to the documentation in this file (e.g. remove the installation
;;        and customization sections added in previous step since these should already be present).
;;     8) Use org-readme-marmalade-post and org-readme-convert-to-emacswiki to post
;;        the library on Marmalade and EmacsWiki respectively.

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put org-gather.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'org-gather)

;;; Customize:
;;
;; To automatically insert descriptions of customizable variables defined in this buffer
;; place point at the beginning of the next line and do: M-x auto-document

;;
;; All of the above can customized by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET org-gather RET
;;

;;; Change log:

NAME is a symbol naming the function.

the expressions.

EXPRESSION are elisp forms. They are wrapped in a `progn' and

  "Gather data from buffer BUF.
VALS should be an alist whose key are names for each piece of data extracted, and whose values are sexp's which
when evaluated in the buffer will return a piece of data.
The sexp's may utilize any functions defined in `org-gather-saved-functions' or any of the following functions
during of the gathering process:

(regex (STR) ...) - search for a match to regular expression STR, and return the match.
                    If STR contains a subexpression, return the match to that instead.
(region (START END &optional SSTART EEND) ...) - return the region between START and END which can be either
                    buffer positions, or regular expressions. If START is a regular expression then the
                    end of the matching text in the buffer will be used for the start position, unless
                    the optional argument SSTART is non-nil in which case the beginning of the match
                    will be used. Similarly for END, except in this case the end of the match is the default
                    position and if EEND is non-nil the start will be used.
(rect (START END SSTART EEND) ...) - same as region but returns the rectangle defined by START and END instead."
